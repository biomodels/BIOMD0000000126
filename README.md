# Model Notes


The model is according to the paper _Na+ Channel Mutation That Causes Both
Brugada and Long-QT Syndrome Phenotypes: A Simulation Study of Mechanism_
Original model comes from ModelDB with accession number: 62661. This is the
wide type model. All the values and reactions obtained from Data Supplement6:
Appendix of the paper. Figure3 has been reproduced by MathSBML. The stimulus
v=-30mV during the time from 5ms to 20 ms displayed in the event. The meaning
for the keyword, C: Close states; O: Open states; IF: Fast inactivation
states; IC: Closed-Inactivation states; IM: Intermediat Inactivation states.
